# TextAdventure

TextAdventure is a text based adventure game written in C++ 14 and XML. Now the great thing is you don't need to know how to code in C++ to make games. You will however need to be able to read and create XML files. With the right XML configuatation you could create any kind of game you like.

Currently most basic commands are done. The bulk of the work needs to be done on the ANTLR grammar and implementing the more complex commands. Also containers and end game conditions need to be implemented as well. I will also work on getting the default config file setup with a small demo game.
