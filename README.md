# TextAdventure

TextAdventure is a text based adventure game written in C++ 14 and XML. Now the great thing is you don't need to know how to code in C++ to make games. You will however need to be able to read and create XML files. With the right XML configuatation you could create any kind of game you like. Future releases will have a utility for making the actual XML file so there will be no need for hand crafting adventures!

Currently most basic commands are done. More complex commands need to be implemented in the actual command code and in the XML configuration file. I will also work on getting the default config file setup with a small demo game.
